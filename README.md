# Az. Start Stop

Az. Start Stop provides a simple interface to define schedules for stopping and starting your Virtual Machines, helping you reduce your compute cost.

<a href="https://vmstartstopdemo.compactcloud.co.uk/">Try it out here!</a>

This solution has been created to address the following key requirements

- User interface to enable your teams to self-manage their compute cost
- Install and managed completely within your own Azure tenancy

# Deployment

Azure (Public)

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsg3-141-592%2FAzStartStop%2Fmain%2FmainTemplate.json)

After installation you'll need to provide _VM Contributor_ and _Cost Management Reader_ permissions to the User Assigned Managed Identity created during deployment.

# Enable Authentication
You can lock down access to Az. Start Stop to limit who can change your schedules to users in your Active Directory.
In the deployed Function App, open the Authentication blade and select "Add identity provider".

Select Identity Provider "Microsoft". The default settings are fine to limit access to users in your Tenant.

### How to create a new build
# Build the frontend content
# Note there seems to be an issue building with npm 9.8.0, node v20.5.1,
# I've been building using v18.7.1
npm run build
# We have to do this to bundle the front-end with the function app
cp -r frontend/dist/ app/dist
# Carry out the build locally creating a full .squashfs build of the app
func azure functionapp publish compactcloud-startstop-1 --build local --build-native-deps
